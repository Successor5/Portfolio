        <p>Hi, I'm Deborah Emmanuel, a software engineer based in Lagos, Nigeria. I recently graduated from Semicolon Africa, a software engineering program that equips young people with the skills to build innovative solutions for the tech industry.</p>
        <p>As a software engineer, I am passionate about creating impactful and meaningful solutions that can solve real-world problems. I have experience in developing full-stack web applications using technologies such as React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.</p>
        <p>In addition to my technical skills, I am a problem-solver and a critical thinker. I believe that the best solutions come from a collaborative effort, which is why I love working in a team environment where I can learn from others and contribute my own ideas.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me reading books or listening to podcasts about technology and entrepreneurship. I also enjoy volunteering in my community and mentoring young people who are interested in pursuing careers in technology.</p>
        <p>I'm excited to continue growing and learning as a software engineer, and I look forward to working on projects that can make a positive impact in the world.</p>
